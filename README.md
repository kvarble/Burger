Eat the Burger! 

Add a burger to the menu using the input box, and then "eat it" by clicking the button. By entering a new burger, the name will be added to the database, and as soon as you click the button to eat it, the status will change in the database.

For this to work, you must install express, mysql, and handlebars.
